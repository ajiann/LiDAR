## Introduction

**LiDAR** is developed for automatedly generating large-scale real-world PIC routing solution while considering specific photonic design rules. LiDAR features a grid-based **curvy-aware A\*** engine with adaptive **crossing insertion**, **congestion-aware net ordering and objective**, and **crossing-waveguide optimization scheme**, all tailored to the unique property of PIC.

</p>

To effciently enable curvy-aware A\* search, we propose parametric curvy-aware methods to generate neighbor candidates based on parametric bending geometry and perform comprehensive DRC check to select legal neighbors for exploration. Each routing node is defned by its spatial location and orientation *(x, y, orientation)*, and we have 45° neighbors to enable 45° routing.

To ensure that only feasible neighbors are considered for exploration, a GridMap-based legality check is necessary. Each routed grids are assigned with the waveguide orientaion for futther crossing insertion.

If a neighbor candidate hits a previously routed waveguide (marked as an obstacle), we need to check whether it is feasible to insert a waveguide crossing to pass through it.

</p>
To further enhance overall port accessibility, several port access assignment techniques are proposed.   

- **Port Propagation**: Propagates the ports that are inside the component' bounding box.
- **Bending-Aware Port Access Region Reservation**: To prevent other waveguides from blocking port regions, grids in front of each port are reserved for the corresponding net, ensuring they cannot be crossed by other nets.
- **Congested Port Spreading**: Spreads the access ports with a predefned extension length and spacing for ports in the same grid.
- **Channel Planning via Staggered Access Point Oﬀsets**: For densely placed ports, we progressively extend the access region length and use staggered access ports to facilitate the placement of consecutive crossings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python >=3.11
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
- klayout and klive (Optional)

### Get the LiDAR Source
```git clone https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/PICRoute.git```

### Usage
#### 1. How to get benchmarks
```bash
cd src/picroute
python benchmarks/clements.py
python benchmarks/MMIports.py
```
Benchmark currently provide photonic computing circuits. Users can generate different size and configuration of benchmarks based on these scripts. 

#### 2. How to run
```bash
cd src/picroute
python scripts/lidar/run_route.py
```
The output layout gdsii files: result/LiDAR/main_results  
The ouput log files: log/LiDAR/main_results

or
```bash
cd src/picroute
python main/picroute.py --benchmark path-to-benchmark --config path to router config
```
The input to LiDAR is formated as netlist and tool's configuration as yaml similar to LEF/DEF.
